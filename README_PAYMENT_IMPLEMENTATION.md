# Payment Status and Payment Method Implementation

## Overview

This implementation adds payment tracking functionality to the Calendary appointment system. When creating reservations, appointments now include payment status and payment method fields.

## Database Changes

### New Fields in `appointments` Table

- `payment_status`: TEXT with values `'pending'`, `'paid'`, `'refunded'`, `'cancelled'`
- `payment_method`: TEXT with values `'on_site'`, `'online'`, `'deposit'`

### Default Values

- New appointments are created with:
  - `payment_status = 'pending'`
  - `payment_method = 'on_site'`

## Implementation Details
